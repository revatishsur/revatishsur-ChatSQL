    The database has a table named 'covid_vaccinations', which is like a simple record book for COVID-19 vaccination details. ⁤It includes a 'Statistic Code' for identifying the type of vaccination data, along with a descriptive name or title 'Statistic Label' for that data. ⁤⁤Each entry is marked with the month it was recorded, and specifies the local electoral area where the vaccinations were carried out. ⁤⁤ ⁤The table lists the age groups of people receiving vaccinations and possibly the measurement unit used in the data. Finally, there's a 'Value' column, which shows the actual numbers, like the count of vaccinations given, making it a straightforward way to track where, when, and to whom COVID-19 vaccinations were administered.
