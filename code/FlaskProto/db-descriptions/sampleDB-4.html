    This database covers all facets of managing and selling music, much like a comprehensive catalog for a record store. The 'albums' and 'artists' tables, for example, contain data about music albums and the artists that made them. While the "employees" table contains data about the store's personnel, the "customers" table keeps track of customer information. To categorize music, it has 'genres' and'media_types' tables. Presumably, sales transactions are managed via the 'invoices' and 'invoice_items' tables, which record purchases and specific items sold. Music playlists and associated tracks are managed by the 'playlists' and 'playlist_track' tables. Comprehensive information on each music tracks, such as album, genre, and price, may be found in the 'tracks' table. There's also a 'rating' table, which contains track ratings from customers or reviewers.
